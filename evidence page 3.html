        <h2>Employability Skills to Improve</h2>
        <p>The employability skill i would like to improve is my communication skills. I want to practice this skill beause its very important in work scenarios and in school. I can develop communication skills at school by, speaking in front of the class and answering questions. I can work in groups an share my ideas and add input to the group. I can ask for help and give others help if need. Greeting people when I enter the class and talking with people I wouldnâ€™t normally talk to. All of this could help me improve my communication skills.</p>
