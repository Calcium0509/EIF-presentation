        <h1>Career goal</h1>
        <p>My career goal is to practice web development and to get better at HTML, CSS and JavaScript because becoming a programmer is what i want to do as a career.</p>
    </div>
    </header>
    <div class="career-goal">
        <h2>Unpacking my goal</h2>
        <p>My career goal is practice web devolvement and make a website in HTML, CSS and JavaScript because it aligns with my strengths, interests, and values. Based on my Identity Web and my Multiple Intelligences quiz, my top strengths include time management, following instructions and being a problem solver. Having these strengths are very important to my goal. Having time management as a strength is good because it helps me plan how I'm gonna archive my goal while balancing other stuff like school and work. Being good at following instructions benefits my goal because to achieve my goal I need to watch a lot of tutorials and to be able to learn I need to be good at following what the tutorials say. Web devolvement takes a lot of critical thinking and problem solving, so having problem solving as a strength is extremely beneficial</p>
        <p>My Multiple Intelligence Type, which is, logic smart, body smart, self-smart and picture smart. Logic type means your good at solving problems and critical thinking. It helps you understand complex coding concepts, debug issues, and create efficient algorithms, which are essential in web development. Body smart shows that you learn best through hands-on activities. This can be beneficial in web development as you can engage in practical coding exercises, build projects, and experiment with different designs to enhance your skills. I think self-smart is one of the most important intelligence types to have. Self-smart reflects your ability to self-reflect and understand your own strengths and weaknesses. It allows you to set realistic goals, stay motivated, and continuously improve your skills in web development. Being picture smart means you have a strong visual ability. This is particularly useful in web development for designing visually appealing websites, understanding layout, and creating user friendly interfaces. On my interests test I got investigative, conventional, realistic and have identified that careers in mathematics, web development and most forms of engineering  match my interests.</p>
        <p>I am excellent at using computer technologies, which will be an asset in web development, and I am working on improving communication skills and being confidante to be even better at web development.  One key capability I want to improve is being self-motivated, as it will help me plan and commit to coding projects. Additionally, a employability skill I aim to enhance is communication Skills again because in web development most of the time you work in a team, so communicating ideas and solving problems together is extremely important.  My top personal value is Honesty, and my top work value is being recognised for my achievements. Honesty is very important when working in a group, I can also be honesty with myself when setting goal, setting goals that I can actually complete. And being recognised for my achievements, makes me feel like what I've accomplished was important and drives me to do more. In the future, I hope to find a career that allows me to live by these values while developing my skills and strengths.</p>

    <div class="evidence-container">
        <div class="evidence">
            <h3>Evidence 1</h3>
            <p>In lesson 1, we created a identity mind map. The goal of this lesson was to learn about our identity, and understand what makes us, us. I looked at my values, goals and my hobbies/interests and how they connect to my career goal statement.</p>

        <div class="evidence">
            <h3>Evidence 1a</h3>
            <p>In lesson 1a, we too a test called the multiple intelligences test. In this test we found out our multiple intelligence type, them being, logic smart, nature smart, self smart, people smart, music smart, word smart, body smart and picture smart. Then we see if we agree and if a peer agrees.</p>

        <div class="evidence">
            <h3>Evidence 2</h3>
            <p>In lesson 2, we took at test to learn about our interest types and skills. Them interest types being, realistic, investigative, artistic, social, enterprising and conventional. We had to see if we agree with thr results of the test.</p>

        <div class="evidence">
            <h3>Evidence 3</h3>
            <p>In lesson 2, we focused on identifying areas for personal development by selecting general capabilities and employability skills to improve. The aim was to reflect on how we can enhance these skills at school to support our growth and future employability.</p>

        <div class="evidence">
            <h3>Evidence 4</h3>
            <p>In lesson 4, i explored the concept of personal and work values, which are fundamental beliefs and principles that guide my behaviours and decision-making. By identifying my top three personal values, honesty, fairness, and empathy i gained insight into what matters most to me in my personal life.</p>

            <h3>Evidence 6</h3>
            <p>In lesson 6, we focused on presenting our learning creatively. I decided to create a website to effectively engage my audience, Matt and Vinny. The website featured clean navigation and organised my work on separate pages. Additionally, it included downloadable test results to provide clear evidence of my learning.</p>

    <div class="feedback">
        <h1>FeedBack</h1>
        <h2>Who i have chosen for feedback</h2>
        <p>I have chosen Joe Davidson to give me feedback because he has experience in ICT and digital technologies. Ive also been watching tutorials online and doing courses online.</p>
        <h2>Why did i choose them</h2>
        <p>I chose Joe because I can show him my strengths and areas for improvement, and he can find out some steps I could take to help me achieve my goal and provide feedback for the work I've done. Ive also been watching the videos online because they have lots of experience and experience in Web development and other forms of coding.</p>
        <audio controls>
            <source src="Feedback for Callum.mp4" type="audio/mp4">
        </audio>
        <h2>How im gonna use this feedback</h2>
        <p>The feedback Joe has given me helped me realize I need to be more clear with my goal and what I want to accomplish. If I could change my goal statement I would be more clear In saying, I want to make intermediate to complex level websites with multiple pages that are visually appealing and easy to navigate. The website would be made with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. He told me to set clear future goals, such as reaching out to small businesses and providing my services to them. This can help me afford future education in the field of programming. Joe also suggested I talk to the I.T staff because they have lots of experience in the ICT field and they can help me with my goal.  He also advised for me to go online and watch videos and live streamers, which is something I'm already doing to achieve my goal. </p>
        <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>I've also been watching tutorials online and doing courses online as a way of learning. I've done this because they have lots of experience and experience in Web development and other forms of coding. </p>

    <div class="action-steps">
        <h2>Action steps</h2>
        <p>Some action steps I can take to complete my goal are, watching tutorials online and taking online courses, but I can also talk to people in person about it like the ICT team at school and other people in the field outside of school. I can set clear and achievable goal like creating small projects, seek regular feedback like what I did with Joe and practice my skills regularly, this might be in school for assignments like this one, personal projects or real work experience.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="action-steps">
        <h2>EdChats action steps</h2>
        <p>To achieve a goal in web development, a Year 10 student should start by defining their goal using the SMART criteria: specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound. Research supports this approach for enhancing focus and motivation. They should then identify resources like online courses and set milestones to break the goal into manageable tasks, as studies show this improves learning. Developing skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript is crucial, with practice through small projects. Seeking feedback from online communities can provide valuable insights. Regular reflection and adjustment of plans will help them stay on track. Staying motivated by celebrating achievements and exploring new technologies will maintain enthusiasm. By following these steps, they can create a purposeful path to success in web development.</p>
