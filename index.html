        <h1>Career goal</h1>
        <p>My career goal is to practice web development and to get better at HTML, CSS and JavaScript because becoming a programmer is what i want to do as a career.</p>
    </div>
    </header>
    <div class="career-goal">
        <h2>Unpacking my goal</h2>
        <p>My career goal is practise web devolvement and make a website in HTML, CSS and JavaScript because it aligns with my strengths, interests, and values. Based on my Identity Web and my Multiple Intelligences quiz, my top strengths include time management, following instructions and being a problem solver. Having these strengths are very important to my goal. Having time management as a strength is good because it helps me plan how I'm gonna archive my goal while balancing other stuff like school and work. Being good at following instructions benefits my goal because to achieve my goal I need to watch a lot of tutorials and to be able to learn I need to be good at following what the tutorials say. Web devolvement takes a lot of critical thinking and problem solving, so having problem solving as a strength is extremely beneficial</p>
        <p>My Multiple Intelligence Type, which is, logic smart, body smart, self-smart and picture smart. Logic type means your good at solving problems and critical thinking. It helps you understand complex coding concepts, debug issues, and create efficient algorithms, which are essential in web development. Body smart shows that you learn best through hands-on activities. This can be beneficial in web development as you can engage in practical coding exercises, build projects, and experiment with different designs to enhance your skills. I think self-smart is one of the most important intelligence types to have. Self-smart reflects your ability to self-reflect and understand your own strengths and weaknesses. It allows you to set realistic goals, stay motivated, and continuously improve your skills in web development. Being picture smart means you have a strong visual ability. This is particularly useful in web development for designing visually appealing websites, understanding layout, and creating user friendly interfaces. On my interests test I got investigative, conventional, realistic and have identified that careers in mathematics, web development and most forms of engineering  match my interests.</p>
        <p>I am excellent at using computer technologies, which will be an asset in web development, and I am working on improving communication skills and being confidante to be even better at web development.  One key capability I want to improve is being self-motivated, as it will help me plan and commit to coding projects. Additionally, a employability skill I aim to enhance is communication Skills again because in web development most of the time you work in a team, so communicating ideas and solving problems together is extremely important.  My top personal value is Honesty, and my top work value is being recognised for my achievements. Honesty is very important when working in a group, I can also be honesty with myself when setting goal, setting goals that I can actually complete. And being recognised for my achievements, makes me feel like what I've accomplished was important and drives me to do more. In the future, I hope to find a career that allows me to live by these values while developing my skills and strengths.</p>

            <h3>Evidence 1a</h3>
            <p>In lesson 1a, we too a test called the multiple intelligences test. In this test we found out our multiple intelligence type, them being, logic smart, nature smart, self smart, people smart, music smart, word smart, body smart and picture smart. Then we see if we agree and if a peer agrees.</p>

        <div class="evidence">
            <h3>Evidence 3</h3>
            <p>In lesson 2, we focused on identifying areas for personal development by selecting general capabilities and employability skills to improve. The aim was to reflect on how we can enhance these skills at school to support our growth and future employability.</p>

        <br>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HGTJBPNC-Gw">The main person i watch online to leaen</a>
        <h2>Why did i choose them</h2>
        <p>I chose joe because I can show him my strengths and areas for improvement, and he can find out some steps I could take to help me achieve my goal and provide feedback for the work I've done. Ive also been watching the videos online because they have lots of experience and experience in Web development and other froms of coding.</p>

    <div class="action-steps">
        <h2>Action steps</h2>
        <p>Some action steps I can take to complete my goal are, watching tutorials online and taking online courses, but I can also talk to people in person about it like the ICT team at school and other people in the field outside of school. I can set clear and achievable goal like creating small projects, seek regular feedback like what I did with joe and practice my skills regularly, this might be in school for assignments like this one, personal projects or real work experience.</p>
