I enjoy doing sports and physical activities and I think I'm pretty good at it, and I like to participate in school sport activities. I also think I'm quite picture smart, I love doing art and working with colors and shapes, I use this skill in website design making sure everything is visually appealing.</p>

                    <p>Callum is pretty passionate about Computer Science and Programming and he seems to have a good idea of what career opportunities that can open for him. He is also very good at programming and coding which are probably the same thing idfk. Callum is pretty athletic on his day and likes to get out if he can be bothered getting out of bed first. </p>

            <h2>Do i agree with my results?</h2>
            <p>I agree with most of my results from the test, but there are a few things I don’t agree in. I do enjoy nature and I enjoy being in it and spending time outdoors but I don’t think it's one of my highest intelligences. I do agree with the rest though, I think I'm logically smart, body smart and picture smart.
